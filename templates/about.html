            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
              I daydream of being a photographer while trying not to fail my PhD.<br> Bulgarian, living in Bristol, UK.<br><br>

              My life summed up in one sentence:
              <blockquote>
                <p>I knew exactly what to do. But in a much more real sense,
                  I had no idea what to do.
                </p>
